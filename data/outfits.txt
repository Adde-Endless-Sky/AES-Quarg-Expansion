Although they didn't find exactly what broke the ring, what they created can serve the same purpose, and is more than enough to protect their homes."

	description "Despite their imposing stature, Quarg bodies are relatively frail and weak when compared to other species. To overcome their natural disadvantages in ground combat, they developed this suit, which combines a flexible, cold nanofiber with a powered, armored exoskeleton, with small, dark porous bits on each end of the forearms, which can focus energy in one particular direction, essentially firing a miniature blaster."
	description "	On top of it all, the suit can momentarily generate a powerful personal shield, providing very high protection to the wearer for its duration. But the Quarg have other means of defending their ships, so this combat suit is almost exclusively used for the ground defense of Quarg ringworlds."
