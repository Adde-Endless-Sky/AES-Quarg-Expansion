	description `The Balaur is the Quarg's ultimate last line of defense, built to guard their ringworlds from any threat. A nigh indestructible defensive platform of a ship, the gargantuan vessel is armed with a unique emitter, a weapon designed to neutralize enemy shields and overwhelm their systems, allowing the Balaur's many Skylances to tear apart opposing forces.`
	description `	Being the newest Quarg ship, a design only a few thousand years old, the Balaur is also their most powerful, embodying their history of constant improvement, culminating in a ship that's been given legendary durability by brute force alone.`
